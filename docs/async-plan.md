# Async/await roadmap

Status: **Phases A, B, C landed**; D (syntax) pending.

MC already has most of the async *runtime* and is missing the *vocabulary* and the *syntax*.
Rather than start with `async`/`await` keywords, we start with the runtime semantics production
needs, in four phases. A→B→C is the product feature; **D (syntax) is ergonomics and a separate
compiler project.**

## What already exists (do not reinvent)

- **Vectored, id-tagged broker**: `SYS_SUBMIT`/`SYS_POLL` with `ToolReq`/`ToolEvent`, request-id
  correlation, `MAX_INFLIGHT`/`MAX_REQ_BYTES`/`MAX_RES_BYTES` quotas (`user/abi.mc`).
- **Context switch + cooperative scheduler**: `mc_switch_context`, `sched_yield`
  (`kernel/core/sched.mc`, `kernel/arch/*/context.mc`).
- **Block/wake**: `WaitQueue` (FIFO, endpoint-based), `block_reasons` mask, `proc_block`/
  `proc_unblock` (`kernel/lib/waitqueue.mc`, `kernel/core/proc_sched.mc`).
- **Missing**: a `Future`/executor vocabulary, an interrupt→wake path for device completions
  (everything is polled today), and `async`/`await` syntax.

## Phase A — Task vocabulary (DONE)

`std/task.mc` — **pure**: it knows nothing about `ProcTable`, IRQs, wait queues, broker slots,
or syscalls. Fixed-size, no hidden heap.

- `trait Future { fn poll(self: *mut Self) -> bool }` — `poll` advances; returns true once
  complete (idempotent). Typed results are read from the concrete future via a per-type accessor
  (today `?T`, `race2_winner`, `timeout_timed_out`); a generic-over-`T` poll return is
  intentionally avoided (MC has no generic tagged unions, and type-erased results would force
  heap/unsafe). Phase D generalizes this to a uniform once-only `take_result() -> T` (see the
  Phase D typed-result ABI) — the trait stays `poll() -> bool`.
- `SlotFuture { id, done: fn(u64)->bool, ready }` — "a request id maps to a pending future",
  with the completion source **injected** so std stays pure (the kernel supplies a `done` backed
  by the inflight table in Phase B). One per in-flight request → callers keep live count ≤
  `MAX_INFLIGHT`.
- Combinators as `Future`s over `*mut dyn Future`: `Join2` (both), `Race2` (either, records
  `winner`), `Timeout` (inner-or-budget, records `timed_out`).
- `run_to_completion(f, idle)` executor — polls to completion, calling `idle` between non-completing
  polls (Phase A: a yield/step hook; Phase B: park / `wfi`).

Gate: `fuzz-task-test` (entry mode, both backends, in diff-backend) — a mock injected completion
source completes each future at a deterministic tick; join2/race2/timeout (both outcomes) +
nested composition verified. The **vectored drain** (`poll_many`) is deliberately deferred to
Phase B because in pure std it needs pointer arithmetic over `*dyn` fat pointers; in the kernel it
iterates the fixed inflight-slot table (typed, bounded).

## Phase B — Park/wake broker (DONE)

`kernel/lib/async.mc` — the scheduler/broker integration std must not contain. A request-id-keyed
inflight table (`Inflight[MAX_INFLIGHT]`, **one `WaitQueue` per slot** — the first option), built
on the proven `wq_wait`/`wq_wake_all` + `proc_park`/`proc_unblock` primitives:

- `async_submit(b) -> id` — reserve a slot, monotonic id, or `ASYNC_NO_ID` if the `MAX_INFLIGHT`
  quota is full.
- `async_await(b, t, id) -> result` — PARK the current task (`wq_wait`) until the slot is ready;
  yields to the next runnable task or `wfi`, re-checks on wake. No busy-spin. **Single-consumer**
  (exactly one task awaits a given id — the submitter); it consumes and frees the slot.
- `async_complete(b, t, id, result)` — mark ready + `wq_wake_one` (matches single-consumer).
- `async_slot_ready(b, id)` — readiness predicate to inject into `std/task.mc`'s `SlotFuture`.

Stackful: one kernel/user stack per parked task, quota-bound by `MAX_INFLIGHT`. Gate: `async-test`
/ `llvm-async-test` (both backends, in m0) — two cooperative processes; a waiter parks on submitted
requests, a completer wakes it (out-of-order, one already-ready), `WCR` + `ASYNC-OK` (result 42).
The kernel-side `poll_many` (vectored drain over the inflight table) is a follow-up here.

**Scope: cooperative only.** `async_complete` is invoked from another *task*, so `async_await`'s
check-then-park is race-free (control only yields at `wq_wait`). It is NOT yet safe against a
completion from interrupt context — that is Phase C (see below), which must add the IRQ-off
wait-prepare. Do not wire `async_complete` to an ISR against this unchanged code.

**Backend parity fix made for this phase:** the LLVM backend emitted non-`export` module functions
with *external* linkage, so two objects that each inline a shared non-export helper (e.g.
`std/fmt_sink.mc`'s `fmt_put_*`) collided (`ld.lld: duplicate symbol`). It now emits `internal`
linkage for non-`export` functions (the analogue of the C backend's `static`) — MC inlines imports
per-object, so per-object copies are correct. This also fixed the pre-existing `llvm-ipc-test`.

## Phase C — IRQ-backed completion (DONE — production-readiness milestone)

A real interrupt completes the in-flight op and wakes the awaiting task — no steady-state polling.
Both requirements that were absent in Phase B are now in place:

1. `async_await_irq(b, t, id, irq_off, irq_on, wfi)` — the IRQ-safe await. Interrupts stay OFF
   across the readiness check, the enqueue-and-park (`wq_prepare_wait`, split out of `wq_wait`),
   AND the idle `wfi`. RISC-V `wfi` resumes on a locally-enabled *pending* interrupt regardless of
   the global enable, and `irq_off` clears only the global bit — so a completion can be neither
   lost between check-and-park nor "taken-and-serviced just before we idle" (the lost-idle race).
   The await briefly enables interrupts only to *take* the pending ISR, then disables and
   re-checks `proc_current_blocked`. `irq_off`/`irq_on`/`wfi` are injected (riscv passes
   `disable_interrupts_global`/`enable_interrupts_global`/`wait_for_interrupt`) so
   `kernel/lib/async.mc` stays arch-neutral. (Precondition: entered with interrupts enabled; it
   uses plain disable/enable, not save/restore. Single waiter per id; `wfi`-idles rather than
   yielding to other runnable tasks — integrating with preemptive multi-task scheduling is broader
   scheduler work.)
2. The ISR wake path stays IRQ-safe by construction — `async_complete` only marks the slot and
   `wq_wake_one` (`proc_unblock`, an atomic bit-clear). No heap, no blocking, no dynamic dispatch;
   the loops are bounded. NOTE: this is not yet *enforced* with `#[irq_context]` — the wake reaches
   `endpoint_slot`, which returns a `Result`, and the MIR irq-context verifier currently rejects
   `Result` construction; closing that (relax the verifier, or a sentinel-returning irq-safe
   endpoint lookup) is a tracked follow-up.

Gate: `async-irq-test` / `llvm-async-irq-test` (both backends, in m0). A single task submits a
request, arms a **single-shot M-mode CLINT timer**, and `async_await_irq` PARKS it in `wfi`. The
timer fires; the M-mode trap vector (a `#[naked]` full-frame handler, 4-byte aligned by the
`#[align]`/naked default — the fix that unblocked this whole interrupt path) disarms the timer and
calls `async_complete` from interrupt context, waking the task. Trace `W I R` (await / completion
in ISR / resume) + `ASYNC-IRQ-OK` (result 42). This is the production shape: a task sleeps until a
device/timer interrupt resumes it.

The same wiring generalizes to a virtio-blk/net completion interrupt — the ISR calls
`async_complete(id, result)` for the finished op instead of a timer; the await side is identical.

## Phase D — `async`/`await` syntax (design contract + build order)

`async fn` lowers to a fixed-size, **stackless** state machine — pure sugar over the Phase-A
`Future`. It is a separate compiler project, greenlit only after A→C (done) prove the semantics.

**The first dependency is the CONTRACT, not the parser.** The parser sugar is the *last* step.
Before any transform we must (a) make the future/result/cancel contract precise, then (b) write
the exact MC the compiler should generate — by hand — as the acceptance fixtures, so "the
transform is correct" means "it emits ordinary MC that matches the hand-written state machines"
on both backends.

### The contract

**1. Typed-result ABI.** Phase A's `Future::poll` returns only readiness (`bool`) — it
deliberately does NOT carry `T` (MC has no generic tagged unions, so a generic `Poll<T>` return
would force heap/unsafe). So `async fn f(..) -> T` has nowhere standard to store/return the `T`
*unless we fix the protocol*. The protocol: **`poll() -> bool` + a generated once-only
`take_result() -> T`** per concrete future:

```
// generated for `async fn f(..) -> T`
struct FFuture { state: u8, /* captured live locals + child futures */ , result: T }
impl Future for FFuture { fn poll(self: *mut FFuture) -> bool { /* state machine */ } }
fn f_take_result(self: *mut FFuture) -> T   // valid EXACTLY ONCE, only after poll() == true
```

`await e` lowers to: poll `e` (suspend — `return false` — whenever `e.poll()` is `false`), then
read `e`'s value via its `*_take_result` accessor and advance. Leaf futures (`SlotFuture`, broker
readiness futures) get the same `take_result` shape, so typed results are uniform across
hand-written and generated futures. (Alternative the transform could adopt instead: a generic
`trait Future<T>` with `result(self) -> T` — same effect; the `take_result` form avoids generic
traits, which MC's procedural generics make awkward.)

**2. `poll()` must never block (the stackless invariant).** A generated `poll()` may ONLY poll
its child futures (Phase-A `Future`s / broker *readiness* futures) and `return false` when a
child is pending. It MUST NOT call the Phase-B/C **blocking** APIs `async_await` /
`async_await_irq` — those are stackful and park the current task. Blocking lives in exactly ONE
place: the *driver* of the top-level future — `run_to_completion` (cooperative) or the kernel
`async_await_irq` (park/wake). So `await` inside an `async fn` is a suspend point that returns
pending up the poll chain, never a park.

**3. Cancellation / drop — v0 rule: NO cancellation; futures must run to completion.** A started
future that holds a `SlotFuture` owns a live `MAX_INFLIGHT` slot (and an enqueued waiter) until it
completes and its result is taken — and `MAX_INFLIGHT` is tiny on an agent OS. In **v0**, every
started future MUST be driven to completion; **dropping a still-pending future LEAKS its slot**.
The transform/executor must reject abandoning a pending generated future, and `race`/`select`
(which leave a loser pending) are **out of scope for v0**. v1 generates a `cancel`/`drop` method
that walks the active child futures and frees their resources via a new broker `async_cancel(id)`
(frees the slot, de-registers the waiter). Until then the leak is a documented, bounded limitation.

**4. Ownership across `await` (the hard part — rules spelled out).** Capture analysis (which live
locals become state fields) must integrate with MC's move/borrow checker:
- a value **moved before an `await` cannot be used after it**;
- a **reference that spans an `await` is forbidden in v0** (allowed later only with a lifetime
  proof that the referent is itself captured into the future — i.e. outlives the suspend);
- **no self-referential future fields** (a field pointing into the same future) unless pinning is
  introduced — so v0 forbids capturing an interior pointer across an `await`;
- a captured local that owns a **resource / has a destructor** must be cleaned up on completion
  AND on cancellation (ties into rule 3).

**5. Control flow across `await` — scope v0 narrowly.** Straight-line and `if`/`else` first;
**loops are a later step.** Linear code maps to a simple state sequence; a loop with an `await`
creates a *re-enterable* state that must preserve the loop index/condition across suspension —
materially harder. Gate v0 with **straight-line + branches**, then add loops.

**6. IRQ context.** `async fn` is forbidden in `#[irq_context]` (it suspends / uses `*dyn`).
Separately, polling an arbitrary `*dyn Future` from `#[irq_context]` stays forbidden (indirect
call). A generated `poll()` could in principle be called from IRQ context only if ALL its callees
are proven IRQ-safe — not worth supporting initially; treat generated futures as task-context only.

### Build order (do NOT start with syntax)

1. **Define the typed future ABI** — `poll()`/`take_result()` (or `Future<T>`); update `std/task.mc`
   leaf futures (`SlotFuture` etc.) to expose `take_result`.
2. **Hand-write the lowered examples** — the exact MC state machines for 2–3 `async fn`s, as
   differential fixtures (both backends). These are the spec and the acceptance target.
   *(Started: `tests/c_emit/fuzz_async_lowering.mc` / `fuzz-async-lowering-test` — pins the
   `poll()`/`take_result()` ABI with single-await and two-awaits-in-sequence, both backends
   agree. The transform's output must match fixtures of this shape; extend with branch/loop/
   moved-after-await cases as steps 4–6 land.)*
3. **Implement the transform for straight-line `await`** — emit MC that matches the fixtures.
4. **Add branches** (`if`/`else` with `await` on one side).
5. **Add loops** (preserve index/condition across suspension).
6. **Add cancellation / resource cleanup** (`cancel`/drop walking child futures).
7. **Only then add the parser sugar** (`async fn` / `await` keywords).

### Acceptance gates (each both-backend, matching the hand-written state machine)

- `async fn` returning a scalar result; two `await`s in sequence; out-of-order child completion;
  branch with `await` on only one side; loop with multiple `await`s;
- a value moved-after-`await` is **rejected**; a reference spanning an `await` is rejected (or proven);
- C and LLVM generated code match the hand-written fixtures.

## Backend follow-up found while building Phase A

The LLVM backend does not yet lower a **`*dyn` dispatch call used directly as an `if`-condition
whose body terminates** (`if self.inner.poll() { return ... }`) — the C backend does. The
parity-clean form is to hoist the dispatch result into a local first (`let r = self.inner.poll();
if r { ... }`), which `std/task.mc` does. Worth fixing in the LLVM `if`/switch lowering so the
hoist isn't required.
