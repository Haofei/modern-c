# C ABI & interop — practical reference

Operational rules for crossing the C boundary and keeping object symbols stable. The
normative spec is `docs/spec/MC_0.7_Final_Design.md` §24 (C ABI and FFI), §16
(address-space types) and §28.1 (symbol attributes); this page is the day-to-day
cheat-sheet plus the error codes you actually hit.

## Calling / exposing C

```mc
extern "C" fn memcpy(dst: *mut c_void, src: *const c_void, n: usize) -> *mut c_void;
extern struct Timespec { tv_sec: i64, tv_nsec: i64 }   // C-ABI struct layout
export fn mc_entry() -> u32 { … }                       // MC function visible to C
```

- **`extern "C" fn …;`** — declare a C function MC may call. Parameter/return types must be
  ABI types (fixed-width ints, floats, pointers, `c_void` pointers, `extern struct`s).
- **`export fn …`** — give an MC function external linkage so C (or another TU) can call it.
- **`extern struct`** — a struct whose layout matches the C ABI (no MC-chosen reordering).

## `c_void`, not MC `void`

`c_void` is the C opaque-object pointee (`void *` ⇒ `*mut c_void`). MC `void` is the unit/no-
value type and has **no** pointer form at the boundary.

| mistake | error |
|---|---|
| `*mut void` at an FFI boundary | `E_MC_VOID_POINTER_FFI` (use `c_void`) |
| `c_void` used as a value/storage type (sized, dereferenced) | `E_C_VOID_NO_LAYOUT` |

`c_void` pointers may be passed, compared, and converted only through explicit FFI
operations — never dereferenced.

## C strings

The normative boundary type is **`cstr`** (ABI-identical to `const char *`, non-null,
NUL-terminated; carries no length). **Status (v0.7): `cstr` is not yet implemented** —
using it raises `E_UNKNOWN_TYPE`. Until it lands, write FFI string parameters as
`*const u8` and maintain the non-null / NUL-terminated invariant at the caller. A string
literal lowers to a `*const u8` (`let s: *const u8 = "hi";`), not a `[]const u8` slice.

## Address-space types at the boundary (§16)

`UserPtr<T>`, `PhysPtr<T>`, `PAddr`, `VAddr`, `DmaAddr` are distinct opaque address
classes — they do not implicitly convert to or from raw integers or each other. Forging
one from an integer is `E_ADDRESS_CLASS_CAST`; construct through the typed constructor
(`pa`/`va`/`dma`/`mmio.map`) or, at a deliberate boundary, in an `unsafe` block (e.g.
`unsafe { p = a as UserPtr<u8>; }`, the kernel/core/uaccess.mc idiom). They lower to a
pointer-width integer in the ABI.

## Stable object symbols (§28.1)

By default an MC symbol's object name is its source name. Two attributes control the
boundary symbol without renaming the source:

- **`#[backend_name("Y")]`** — emit declaration `X` under object symbol `Y` (RSS/namespace
  isolation; lets two source `X`s coexist as distinct object symbols). A trait/inherent
  method and a `#[backend_name]` clash is `E_DUPLICATE_BACKEND_NAME`.
- **`#[origin("generated"|"copied"|"ported"|…)]`** — classify an FFI/boundary declaration
  so tooling can tell ported source from bound/generated/copied-runtime code.

Both backends (`emit-c`, `emit-llvm`) must agree on the emitted symbol; the `diff-backend`
gate enforces C-vs-LLVM agreement across the host fixtures.

## Trap ABI

Safety-check failures call the `mc_trap_*` family (`mc_trap_Assert`, `mc_trap_Bounds`,
`mc_trap_DivideByZero`, …). A freestanding/host link must provide these symbols; they
typically `__builtin_trap()` (an illegal instruction). `#[no_lang_trap]` forbids emitting
a language trap edge in a region (`E_NO_LANG_TRAP_EDGE`) for code that must not trap.

## Testing across the boundary

`#[test]` functions (see below) are ordinary `export fn name() -> u32` returning 1, so
the test runner links them exactly like any C-visible MC symbol:

```mc
#[test]
export fn round_trips() -> u32 { assert(parse(serialize(x)) == x); return 1; }
```

- `mcc list-tests <file>` enumerates `#[test]` functions.
- `tools/test/mc-test-runner.sh <mcc> <c|llvm> <file>` runs each process-isolated and
  reports pass/fail by name (a failing `assert` traps the child). Gated by `mc-test` /
  `llvm-mc-test` in `m0`.

## Quick error index

| code | cause |
|---|---|
| `E_MC_VOID_POINTER_FFI` | `void` pointer at an FFI boundary — use `c_void` |
| `E_C_VOID_NO_LAYOUT` | `c_void` used where a sized/dereferenceable type is needed |
| `E_ADDRESS_CLASS_CAST` | forging an address-class pointer from a non-address value |
| `E_DUPLICATE_BACKEND_NAME` | two declarations resolve to the same object symbol |
| `E_NO_LANG_TRAP_EDGE` | a trap edge emitted inside `#[no_lang_trap]` |
| `E_UNKNOWN_TYPE` (`cstr`) | `cstr` is normative but unimplemented in v0.7 |
